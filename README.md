# PowerLinker

**Class:** Spielerei

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

This is a small example application demonstrating the possibility to augment existing external web services (in this case linkedin) with additional functionality (in this case downloading a list of users connected to your account together with the company they work for and the area that company is in.)

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the PowerLinker project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh
```
